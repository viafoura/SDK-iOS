# Viafoura iOS SDK

This library allows you to integrate Viafoura tools into a native iOS app.

### Add the SDK to your project

#### Using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)
1. Set dependency as follows:
    `pod 'ViafouraCore'
2. Execute `pod install` in Terminal
3. Open workspace file and run

#### Using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager)
The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler.
Once you have your Swift package set up, adding SpotIM as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.
